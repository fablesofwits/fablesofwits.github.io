            <p><b>Pilmeyer Patrick</b> : <br/>
            I have worked more than 10 years in software engineering and I have decided to put my skills into making tactical games.<br/>
            Tactical games are scratching my itch from problem solving but bigger they are, more they can be vector of self-expression and storytelling.</p>
